# Milestone 5: Evaluation & Deployment 

## Evaluation

### Summary
In order to adequately test our application, we leveraged our existing scenarios and personas to identify a process that would help inform whether the existing prototype truly meets the needs and expectations of our target users. In a broad sense, we hope to serve the general Ithaca community; however, our application is tailored to the experience of forging new connections. This lends itself to users who may be new to the Ithaca, new to the Farmer's Market, or looking for new people and exciting experiences. Therefore, our test plan consisted of walking users through the four scenarios while embodying the personas that accompany them. 

Our user testing involved introducing the users to our application and session, walking through the scenarios, gaining feedback, and thanking users for their time. 

***Sample introduction script.*** Hi, and thanks so much for being a part of our user testing. We created this application to help build meaningful connections at the Farmer's Market through vendor information, scavenger hunts, and punchcards. Today we're going to walk through four scenarios that have tasks and contexts to address. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, feel free to stop the session at any time. 

By analyzing how potential users mitigated the situations and problems in the scenario and gaining their feedback, we were provided insight on how to move forward with any revisions. We asked each user to verbally narrate their actions while completing the scenario tasks to gain an understanding for their decisions and logic. The details of how each scenario was evaluated is as follows:

#### Scenario 1

Lee is trying to be more conscious of his spending and eating habits by cooking his meals at home more often. His close friend, Rebecca, buys her groceries at the Farmer’s Market and is an advocate for buying locally sourced goods. Lee wants to follow in Rebecca’s footsteps and see if he can make a tasty meal from ingredients he can find at the Farmer’s Market. He’s also hoping that going to the Farmer’s Market more often will offer more insight on locally sourced foods by familiarizing himself with the vendors and understanding where the foods come from. The problem is, he doesn’t want to go out of his way to research these recipes and vendors. Lee needs to find a way to easily purchase ingredients from vendors to make new recipes.

* Main target audience(s):
    * Ithaca community members who are looking for new experiences (in this case, related to locally sourced foods)
    * Ithaca community members who are new to the Farmer's Market
* Evaluation details:
    * Introduced scenario and persona
    * Allowed user to attempt task in context provided while narrating their actions and any reasoning
    * Asked for any thoughts and feedback


#### Scenario 2
Michaela moved to Ithaca 2 weeks ago with her husband and 3 children. She is an expert in cooking and cannot wait to use local ingredients to make special dishes for her family. She enjoys going to the farmer’s market with the whole family members, because she believes this helps her children to understand green and healthy living. Exploring the special, unfamiliar food provided in the farmer’s market could be a good theme for Michaela’s every week family activities. Michaela wants to find and learn how to cook unfamiliar food with families.

* Main target audience(s):
    * Ithaca community members who are looking for new experiences (in this case, family focused)
    * Ithaca community members who are new to the Farmer's Market

* Evaluation details:
    * Introduced scenario and persona
    * Allowed user to attempt task in context provided while narrating their actions and any reasoning
    * Asked for any thoughts and feedback


#### Scenario 3
Jenna just moved to Ithaca and wants to meet new people. She heard from her co-workers that the Farmer’s Market is a great place where a majority of community members tend to visit on the weekends. Given her co-workers’ recommendations, Jenna decides to try out the market in the hopes of meeting new people. Jenna has gone a couple times already and has made friends with a few vendors she’s bought from. She wants to see what vendors she doesn’t often go to so that she can meet and get to know new people.

* Main target audience(s):
    * Ithaca community members who are looking for new experiences (in this case, meeting new people)
    * Ithaca community members who are new to the Farmer's Market
    * Ithaca community members who are new to the area

    * Asked for any thoughts and feedback


#### Scenario 4 
Kaitlyn often visits the Farmer’s Market to buy her weekly groceries. However, since she lives relatively far from the market, she’s getting a bit tired of making the trip just to get groceries. She wants to explore non-food products at the market so that she can make the most of her time when she visits every week.

* Main target audience(s):
    * Ithaca community members who are looking for new experiences (in this case, breaking routine)
* Evaluation details:
    * Introduced scenario and persona
    * Allowed user to attempt task in context provided while narrating their actions and any reasoning

### User Test #1
#### Participant
A member of the Ithaca community who had just moved to the area for university five months ago. They fall into the central target group of *Ithaca community members who ar new to the area*.

#### Transcribed Notes
Began the session why providing some background on the application and test session through the use of the scripts detailed above. The user expressed that they needed to grasp an understanding of the application beforehand. They seemed confused at first.

*Testing Scenario 1*
* user looks through the home screen
* clicks on the "Pesto & Goat Cheese Risotto"
* scrolls through the recipe page, looking through the different ingredients and instructions
* notices the "X vendors available" description under each item
* clicks on "Rice"
* a bit confused on the scanning feature – "what does scanning vendor mean?"
* finds the list of vendors that carry "Rice"
* task is completed
* expresses that it was a pretty easy and intuitive task to complete

*Testing Scenario 2*
* user seemed confused at first about the task at hand
* "isn't this like the first scenario?"
* user starts on the home page and clicks into recipe again
* "this would be where I go to look for food to cook"
* returns to home page
* clicks on diy hunt in curiosity
* scrolls through, reading the ingredients and instructions
* "and I guess this is where I would go for food to get while I'm at the Farmer's Market"
* task completed
* expresses that it was simple, but sort of redundant with the first scenario

*Testing Scenario 3*
* user seems to think for a moment
* clicks on "Collections"
* reads the achievements, badges, and cards
* "seems like there are different amounts of things collected for each of these vendors"
* "I would probably visit one with a lower amount of stamps"
* task completed
* expresses that the task was straightforward, but that the scenario doesn't really emphasize or clarify what the punchcards are or how they're populated
* "I would probably need to thoroughly use the app at the market to really get a good grasp for how it works"

*Testing Scenario 4*
* user begins on the home page
* immediately clicks on the product hunt
* looks through the items and instructions
* clicks into "Tinted Sunglasses"
* task completed
* expresses that the task was pretty easy given the explorations made in the previous scenarios

*General Feedback & Takeaways*
* application would be difficult to understand without the proper background knowledge or use "in the field"
* very appealing visual design
* gained a better understanding of how the app works as the tasks went on
* thinks that the application fulfills identified needs
* would look into how to communicate the scanning feature more effectively
