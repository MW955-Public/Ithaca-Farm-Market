# Milestone 2: Discovery & Exploration

## Gathering Information
### Methodology [Edited 11/09/2019]
Our information gathering process began with a brainstorming of potential problem spheres that might be featured at the Farmer's Market. In narrowing our focus down to the social aspects, we wanted to embody a theme of communication connections by conducting user interviews and field studies at the market. We felt that these methods fit our identified focus the best because it would involve integrating ourselves into the social sphere of the market through directly interacting and observing users. The user interviews would allow us to gain a closer understanding of user motivations and behaviors, while field studies would allow us to naturally analyze visitor behaviors and tendencies to draw specific patterns and conclusions. In order to proceed with these user interviews, we generated an outline of interview questions (detailed below) to ask when we visited. Since there are five members on our team, we decided to split up into two teams and conduct our information gathering sessions across two days over the weekend of 10/26/2019 and 10/27/2019. 

At the farmers market, we conducted the aforementioned methods of information gathering to achieve a holistic perspective of the surrounding social climate. On Saturday, we conducted semi-structured interviews based loosely on the theme of community relationships. We believed it would be best to utilize semi-structured interviews as it suited the casual nature of the Farmer's Market while also allowed for unique insight into the large problem scope of social interactions. These findings were supplemented by samples of quantitative data as we counted how many people were entering/leaving the market as individuals vs. groups while also taking note of how large the size of each group was. On Sunday, conducted another round of semi-structured interviews at lesser depth but with a higher number of diverse people. We decided to vary the depth between the two days as we wanted to capture as much of the general population as possible while still allowing time to dive into individual concerns and draw substantial findings. These were again supplemented by field study observations of interactions. Below are our preliminary research protocol, interview notes and findings, photos, and artifacts pertaining to our research phase at the Farmer's Market.

The information and data collected from both trips were then summarized (as seen below) and shared with the rest of the group to debrief and consolidate findings.

### User Interviews
* *Stall owner.*
    * Has been at farmer’s market regularly for many years. 
    * Sees several customers regularly, but most are new week-to-week. 
    * They have noticed that most who come alone are very driven by shopping, and are often not interested in chatting.
* *Cornell parent, visiting his son.*
    * Student has expressed interest in coming to the farmer’s market, but does not have transportation.
* *Couple who visits market when in town.*
    * Enjoy the local-ness.
    * Only come together to the farmer’s market.
* *Man wandering alone.*
    * Usually comes with his wife, sometimes with other friends if he can find people. 
    * Doesn’t usually plan trips, just decides to come and wander. 
    * He is most interested in food.
* *Cornell Math professor and Caltech visiting professor.*
    * Math professor comes every week for groceries and usually comes alone; came with visiting professor this week, but that’s more situational and not something that happens routinely.
    * Math professor says that Wegman’s and other similar large supermarkets are overwhelming because there’s so many options, whereas at the farmer’s market, it’s more familiar and they can visit the same vendors on a weekly basis. Visits co-ops otherwise.
    * Caltech visiting professor said everything at the farmer’s market looks more appealing than stuff in grocery stores.
    * Math professor said she feels like most people in the Ithaca community come to the farmer’s market and will typically see people they recognize like co*workers. Doesn’t speak to people unless they’re already acquainted, even vendors who they regularly visit.
    * Math professor doesn’t really make new friends at the farmer’s market – seems to come for more of a functional purpose that has become habitual.

### Field Study Observations
* Many more groups than individuals
* Small groups tend to stick together, not often intermingling
* Stallkeepers only ever engage with one group at a time

![field study observations](/documents/brainstorming/informationGathering/informationGathering2.jpg)

* Within a timed 5 minute period, we measured how many people entering or leaving were individuals vs. groups
    * **Individual:** 7
    * **Group:** 15
* Within a timed 5 minute period, we measured the size of the group
    * **1 person:** 7
    * **2 people:** 13
    * **3 people:** 1
    * **4 people:** 4
    * **5 people:** 1

### Affinity Diagrams [Edited 11/09/2019]

As a method of organizing the interview data, we generated an consolidated affinity diagram to further narrow down our project scope.

![affinity diagram](/documents/brainstorming/informationGathering/affinityDiagram1.jpg)

As can be seen in the diagram, the users can be sorted into two groups: (1) those who are goal oriented and (2) those who go to the market with a specific goal in mind like discovering food, product, and produce options.

### Executive Summary of Findings [Edited 11/09/2019]

Ultimately, in the process of analyzing and organizing our collected information, we arrived at 3 key findings that best represent the user's needs/goals.
1) Non-goal-oriented visitors of the Farmer's Market need something to guide their discovery of the various offerings at the market. There are many different options, which can often be overwhelming.
2) Goal-oriented visitors need a way to expand their horizons outside of their comfort zone and venture into different stalls or experiences.
3) Vendors and visitors and non-related vistors often do not engage with each other in an in-depth manner, regardless of if the visitors are goal-oriented or non-goal-oriented.


## Problems [Edited 11/09/2019]

* Parking
* Changing stalls make it hard to know what’s available

*Primary Problem*
* **Hard to build connections with other people**
    * Vendor-customer vs customer-customer relationships
    * Groups tend to be insular
    * Some people are more task oriented, whereas others have a flexible schedule
    * Visitors who come to the Farmer’s Market routinely as opposed to those who visit based on circumstances and situation

*Secondary Problem*
* Difficulty in choosing which stall to visit
    * frequent visitors often go to the same stalls consistently
    * patrons are very habitual and don't typically explore new options
    * newcomers have too many options to choose from and not enough information on products


## Value Propositions [Edited 12/04/2019]

We hope to improve the Ithaca Farmer’s Market experience by provoking novel social interactions within the community. Our PWA aims to address our main problems by helping build connections with other people, all the while providing a gateway for customers to visit new stalls. In using our PWA, we hope to add value to the market by: **(1)** giving joy in forming close relationships, and **(2)** introducing exciting novel recipes or hunts for visitors to incorporate into their daily lives.

***Joy from forming close relationships.*** People are social in nature. When pairing the intimate nature of a Farmer's Market with the motivation of a scavenger hunt, visitors are united by a shared goal of completing the task before them. Not only are inter-customer interactions encouraged, but customer-vendor interactions are facilitated as well. In having customers converse with vendors more, they could have a better understanding of where their food comes from and thus a better appreciation of the goods they consume. Meeting new people, whether it be fellow patrons or vendors, would naturally occur given the different interactions that would ensue. Furthermore, the joy received from forming close relationships has a knock-on effect, as the community would strengthen and become a environment where people can support each other.

***Introduce novel recipes.*** One recurring problem found throughout multiple interviews was that people were easily flooded by the myriad of options at the Farmer's Market and would simply resolve to just going to the same stalls over and over again. Our PWA tackles this by introducing novel recipes and hunts to visitors, thus giving users a reason to visit a variety of stalls. These novel recipes are also saved on their application, and thus can provide exciting adventures to attempt at any point. If the thrill of novelty is not encouragement enough, users are incentivized to complete these recipes as it helps them fill out punch cards which provide future discounts or deals.

Although the value that this PWA brings to the Farmer's Market is clearly evident, there still remains barriers to adopting this tool into one's routine. For example, this may not be the most attractive option to those who attend the Farmer's Market with a goal-oriented approach. Another cost to adopting this application is that the recipes may be limited. Since we are only providing 3 recipes each week, users may feel dissuaded if the options do not match their preference.

There are no direct alternatives to this PWA, but there exists other options for its individual features. For example, people could look up thousands of recipes online through various sources (i.e. recipe and food-centric applications like Tasty). Furthermore, users could specify specific food interests that they are attempting to explore. That being said, our team believes that this PWA still has the potential to thrive regardless of the alternatives as it provides a unique and tailored goal-oriented approach towards exploring local produce and goods at the Ithaca Farmer's Market.

## Scenarios [Edited 12/04/2019]

### Scenario 1
Lee is trying to be more conscious of his spending and eating habits by cooking his meals at home more often. His close friend, Rebecca, buys her groceries at the Farmer’s Market and is an advocate for buying locally sourced goods. Lee wants to follow in Rebecca’s footsteps and see if he can make a tasty meal from ingredients he can find at the Farmer’s Market. He’s also hoping that going to the Farmer’s Market more often will offer more insight on locally sourced foods by familiarizing himself with the vendors and understanding where the foods come from. The problem is, he doesn’t want to go out of his way to research these recipes and vendors. Lee needs to find a way to easily purchase ingredients from vendors to make new recipes.

### Scenario 2
Michaela moved to Ithaca 2 weeks ago with her husband and 3 children. She is an expert in cooking and cannot wait to use local ingredients to make special dishes for her family. She enjoys going to the farmer’s market with the whole family members, because she believes this helps her children to understand green and healthy living. Exploring the special, unfamiliar food provided in the farmer’s market could be a good theme for Michaela’s every week family activities. Michaela wants to find and learn how to cook unfamiliar food with families.

### Scenario 3
Jenna just moved to Ithaca and wants to meet new people. She heard from her co-workers that the Farmer’s Market is a great place where a majority of community members tend to visit on the weekends. Given her co-workers’ recommendations, Jenna decides to try out the market in the hopes of meeting new people. Jenna has gone a couple times already and has made friends with a few vendors she’s bought from. She wants to see what vendors she doesn’t often go to so that she can meet and get to know new people.

### Scenario 4
Kaitlyn often visits the Farmer’s Market to buy her weekly groceries. However, since she lives relatively far from the market, she’s getting a bit tired of making the trip just to get groceries. She wants to explore non-food products at the market so that she can make the most of her time when she visits every week.


## Personas [Edited 12/05/2019]

***Jenna.*** This persona is an elementary school teacher at the local Ithaca elementary school. She recently moved to Ithaca with her husband Jack. Jenna is excited to start a new life in such a cute little town, and she really enjoys locally-sourced goods, niche festivals and events, picking up new hobbies, and close-knit communities. One of her co-workers at the school told her about the Ithaca Farmer’s Market; this piques her interest as she regularly used to visit the one in her hometown. Since the town was small, the community was really tight knit since all the vendors were neighors or friends who lived not far away. Back there, she was always updated with what was in season or when specific produce was in harvest. However since coming to Ithaca, she feels hesitant to go because she doesn’t know much about the community or the people. She doesn’t know how to pick from the myriad of stalls here, and has no idea where to start building these new relationships in this new town.

## Theme [Edited 12/05/2019]

***Building a close-knit community.*** The ultimate theme of our project is to strengthen and grow the farmers market community. Based on research, it seems like patrons typically don’t spend time to connect with vendors of the Farmer’s Market despite those who regularly visit the same stalls. Facilitating these relationships could strengthen the Ithaca community by building a network of new connections. In this case, this goal is accomplished through interactions within the participants of the farmer’s market, encompassing both patron-patron relationships as well as vendor-patron relationships. This could be tested through the amount of stamps and diverse set of vendor cards that users can collect.

***Making visits to the Ithaca Farmer's Market a fun experience.*** Novelty is often paired with excitement. When routinely doing something in a habitual manner, even a feat as inticing as going to the Farmer's Market can get boring. Our goal is to ensure that every trip to the market can be a different experience than the last. By varying the social interactions and sprinkling elements of surprise and persuasion, the Farmer's Market transforms from a weekly task into a weekly treat. this This could be tested through how robust the user's completed hunts, achievements, and badges are.
