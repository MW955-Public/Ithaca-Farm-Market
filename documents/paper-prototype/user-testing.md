# User Testing

## Scenarios

***Scenario 1.*** Having grown up in Ithaca, Valentin is a regular at the farmer’s market. He attends every week, and knows exactly which stall has the best cabbage. His visits at the farmer’s market are very goal-oriented, as he purchases his weekly produce there on a habitual basis. Elaine on the other hand feels intimidated by the wide range of options that the market provides. She is trying to buy cabbage, but there are a multitude of stalls that are all offering slight variations of the same vegetable. Elaine needs to form a connection with Valentin in order to better understand her cabbages, to ultimately make a decision on which to buy.

***Scenario 2.*** Genevieve, a math professor at Cornell, is having a really rough week. She’s swamped with grading exams, completing her research, and writing grant proposals; all this has left her stressed and lonely. She would like to break this rhythm and get off campus. Newlyweds, Jim and Jane, are also professors at Cornell. Lately they have been arguing, and are getting a bit sick of each other. They’re used to going to the farmer’s market together, but can’t imagine spending that much time alone together. Jim and Jane would love some company, but don’t know if any of their friends or colleagues are interested in going. They need to find one another with the shared interest of the farmer’s market in order to alleviate their personal issues.

***Scenario 3.*** Trey is a local gardener who sometimes sells wild flowers at the farmer’s market. Teresa is an artist who often works with flowers in many of her sculptures. Teresa normally buys her flowers at Tops, having never considered the farmer’s market as a potential place to buy. Teresa is organizing a flower arrangement workshop event, and doesn’t know of other flower enthusiasts to help program this event. She needs a way to connect to Trey as a partner in hosting the event.
