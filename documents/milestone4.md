# Milestone 4: High-Fidelity Prototype
## Revisions to Prior Work
In  this milestone we have made adjustments to the form and function of the application designs we had laid out in our design phase. We have refined our application in the interest of catering to users with a specific goal. This goal is best described as a desire to use the Ithaca Farmer's Market to form connections among the larger Ithacan community. This is held in opposition to our previous designs, which catered to a larger and altogether more disparate set of functions. This change was motivated by our time constraints and a desire for simplicity. 

The final design of our application is encapsulated in two interrelated parts: Hunts and Collections. Hunts are given recepies and collections of products. A hunt is given with a list of ingeredients and associated vendors for each, encouraging users to visit vendors which they have little previous association with. Collections are a set of awards for users for completed hunts. Collections include specific awards for actions in the app which arre community building, punch cards for each visit to a vendor, and previously completed hunts. The exact details of how these changes will be implemented can be found in /documents/wireframes.
