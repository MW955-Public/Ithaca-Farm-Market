# Milestone 3: Design

## Persuasive Design

***Persuasive Design and Behavior.*** Given that our application is set to focus on building community connections through the Ithaca Farmer's Market, our persuasive design approach complements and facilitates this theme. The specific target behavior can be described as connecting with community members and vendors and building those relationships by spending time together at the Farmer's Market. We hope to directly encourage this behavior through the use of a badge system and the incentives that accompany special group discounts or benefits at certain vendors. Other features of the application also encourage this behavior: **(1)** a hunt page that promotes searching for food product and non-food product. **(2)** ingredient and vendor page that allows users to search for corresponding vendors who sell the ingredients in order to make the product. **(3)** a collection page as a incentives to encourage users to visit and familiarize with the vendors by collecting stamp and punch cards in order to get discounts or acquire badges.  

***Design Approach and Justification.*** Although our design revolves around the mission to create connections, the main focus of our persuasive design will be through this badge-incentive system. In thinking though the persuasive design, we based our process on the *Fogg Behavior Model* in considering the three elements of behavior change: motivation, ability, and prompt. We found that our target behavior seems to be prevented through a combination of all three of these elements – most visitors want to make new connections and would like the convenience and satisfaction of doing so, but it's difficult because there isn't an easy or efficient way to do so. Their motivation isn't high enough for them to self-start these relationships, and there's a lack of avenues to catalyze such behavior. By pushing this badge-incentive system in conjunction with the other features of the application, we would encompass all three of these aspects – the badges and stamp card collection as incentives would lead to higher motivation, the list of vendors for making the ingredients  would make it easier to build connections(ability). 

## Brainstorming

In the brainstorming stage, we first came up with a couple of key points that should be included in our app design. These points include making connections with people in the same community, the joy users can receive from establishing relationship with others, awareness of food background. Then, we also think of what features we need to design and implement in order to reach these points or goals. We came up with different components, such as profile page for vendors and customers. Each vendor has their own specialty, such as the items they sell the best or are the most popular, or any discount or badges they have in order to attract more customers. In order to build connection with the vendor, there should be a feature which allows the users to chat or call the vendors. Then, we also came up with some ideas of sharing rides in order to build connection between users and support each other when someone has transportation issues. 

We also think of what API we should use in order to implement feature in our app and at the same time satisfy the project's requirement, such as using weather API to display the weather condition for each day, as the weather condition, to a large extent, influences people's intention of going to the Ithaca Farmer's Market and also might cause transportation issue. In addition to it, we might also need Google Map API in our sharing rides section to locate each other, as sharing rides could also help establish relationship with each other. 

Then at the end of the brainstorming process, each of us sketched possible design pattern on the paper. Some of us drew the profile page, some of us drew details about sharing rides sections, and some of us drew the UI flows, the transition between each page. We then put our individual's pieces together and figured out how many main pages we need to design and implement. At the end, each of the person in the team was assigned to a section to design and prepare to discuss before user testing. 

The following are the notes from that conversation:
* making connections
    * being able to communicate with connections
* joy of relationships
* awareness of food background
* profile
    * when you usually go to the farmer's market (time)
    * avatar photo
    * what stalls you frequent
    * vendor vs. visitor styling
    * reviews
        * "great for..."
        * "known for..."
    * contact information
* APIs
    * google maps API --> automate data
    * weather API
* Rides
    * transportation
    * ride-share
* Group Discounts
    * credit incentive
    * connections --> display who and how often
* Mobile > Desktop

Below are each are of our takes from the brainstorming conversation:

## Sketches

![flow](/documents/sketches/flow.jpg)
This sketch shows an initial venture into defining the overall flow of the application.

![discover](/documents/sketches/discover.jpg)
This sketch represents the home feed and discover pages, allowing users to interact with the Farmer's Market community and to find new sources of information about the Farmer's Market.

![connections](/documents/sketches/connections.jpg)
The connection pages represent a user's ability to communicate with vendors and other users in the Farmer's Market community. These include (left to right) a list of all connections, a chat between two users, and the connection portion of a user profile. 

![ridesharing](/documents/sketches/ridesharing.jpg)
These sketches are ridesharing pages. We assume that people could start their connections easily from the ridesharing. These sketches show how people post a ridesharing request and get connection with people who give rides.

![Personal-Profile](/documents/sketches/personal-profile.jpg)
The user profile pages represent a view for users into the details of other users involvement in the market.

![vendor-profile](/documents/sketches/vendor-profile.jpg)
These sketches are vendors' profiles, including vendors' details, product's details and coupon information. These sketches are concerned about if people could build connection both with vendors directly and other customers who share reviews or posts.


## Paper Prototype & Evaluation

## Participant #1
### Scenario #1
- went to search cabbage
- went to post
- saw kim k’s cabbage post said ally’s farm
- went back to vendors and ally’s farm
- went really well!

### Scenario #2
- goes to ride-sharing
- doesn’t want ride-sharing
- sees connection but wants someone new
- search
- interested in apple cider so goes into that trending topic
- sees good post
- goes to her profile
- connected with her first
- chats her

### Scenario #3
- goes to search
- searches flowers
- confused on what to compare to
- looks through different vendors
- finds one and then messages them

### Suggestions
- didn’t really use ride sharing
- trust with people and how many stars

## Participant #2
### Scenario #1
- looking through the home screen
- hard to imagine how to complete this task
- will randomly click things to get familiar with the platform
- wants to understand what functionality it provides
- goes to ride sharing and then connections
- searches for cabbage and goes to community then vendor
- looks at different vendor pages
- knows rating of vendor but doesn’t know if they can trust it
- thought that it would be a forum
- goes to community then posts
- sees kim and goes to their profile
- imagine their post to be in their profile too
- wants to see more detail about the messages/posts
- put someone’s interests
- thinks that when clicking connect, will open dialogue box to chat or some message or instruction
- chat and phone maybe not clear?
- clicks on chat
- is confused whether chat or call is in the app or via phone
- mail icon is confusing for chat
- got information form chatting more information about vendor
- trust in vendors depends in reputation of the app
- would use the info provided by the user with the vendor to confirm cabbage and then make decision
- will compare different vendors from asking around

### Scenario #2
- trying to post to the community page
- should probably add a post option
- searches “free rides”
- goes to posts
- then goes to ride sharing
- scrolls through options and then as a passenger
- fills out form
- would want more indicators to visualize time frame
- posted a ride but didn’t look at any people
- could be that scenario was unclear?
- would click on profile to see post

### Scenario #3
- searches flowers
- clicks on vendor
- will call
- looks through different vendors
- sees different quality vendors
- and calls 

## Participant #3
### Scenario #1
- seems unfamiliar with the testing method
- searches cabbage and clicks a vendor
- goes back to search and posts
- clicks on a person’s profile
- goes to community and connects with member
- goes back to vendor page
- it might be that our scenario’s are too confusing?
- clicks on ride
- seems to just be exploring the application
- clicks on connection
- picks first vendor

### Scenario #2
- goes to search
- searches cabbage (their interest)
- goes to posts
- clicks on someone’s profile
- connects with the person
- wants to chat
- sends message asking - introduce and ask what she likes and when she has free time

### Scenario #3
- searches flowers
- clicks vendor
- sends message 
- doesn’t care about event
- choose another vendor
- messages them
- really cares about event

## Debrief
- users seemed more interested in just exploring the app than completing tasks
- debate over whether or not to keep ridesharing 
    -maybe combine ride-sharing with search
    -maybe combine ride-sharing with home-feed posts
- reduce volume of information on vendor/customer profile pages
- people seem to want to message directly after connecting
- create distinct types of posts (including rides)

## Wireframes
Please see [wireframes](/documents/wireframes/wireframes.pdf)  for a comprehensive view of the wireframes we constructed based on our sketches and user evaluations. The flow in regards to how these wireframes connect can be seen in [flow](/documents/wireframes/flow.pdf).

## Rationale
Our app’s design revolves around the key pillar of human connection. All our design decisions were made with providing this value to our users. This can be seen in multiple forms of: **(1)** query/language use, **(2)** emphasis of human characteristics, and **(3)** the increased exposure to others in the community.

***Query/Language use.*** In order to mimic human dialogue, queries were requested in a question format. For example, when inputting details into the rideshare requests, each prompt is asked through a straightforward and informal question. Furthermore, these requests generate a short message that is read like a status rather than a list of fields.

***Emphasis of Human Characteristics.*** The innate human attraction towards faces has led us to emphasize these pictorial characteristics rather than just names. We have utilized user avatars as much as we can, complemented by self-personalized badges and frames.

***Increased Exposure to Others in the Community.*** Through the various “posts” that can be made, this app often suggests the interaction with others in the community. In having a centralized forum of events and happenings, users can both actively and passively be a part of the farmer’s market community.
 
Based on the scenarios we identified in previous milestones, we believe that our current design adequately addresses those indicated needs through our bouts of user testing and development of the paper prototype.
 
Our application addresses the main problems we identified: **(1)** parking, **(2)** changing vendors make it difficult to track available goods, and **(3)** difficulty of building meaningful connections with others. Through the integration of a ridesharing feature, we hope to promote co-transport and thus time spent together by encouraging carpooling at the convenience and willingness of the Ithaca community members. This may indirectly mitigate some issues with parking as the more ridesharing that occurs, the less cars and therefore more accessible parking that could ensue. In regards to the difficulty in tracking available vendor goods, the vendor profiles would hopefully increase the ease in accessibility for patrons to find relevant information in terms of the products they are interested in. These vendor profiles include a list of products or goods that are available as well as the ones that they may specialize in. This streamlines the process of inventory management and communication from vendors to patrons. Lastly, the main problem we hope to address, the difficulty of building meaningful connections with others, is the central focus of all features included in the application as they all work in conjunction to fulfill this need. Features like patron count, badges/coupons, messaging, ridesharing, and discover are all designed to facilitate an exchange of interests and ideas in order to forge meaningful relationships within the community. 
 
The specific target behavior can be described as connecting with community members and building those relationships by spending time together at the Farmer's Market and beyond. This behavior would be encouraged through such features that involve some combination of Fogg’s three elements: motivation, ability, and prompt – for example, badges/coupons create an incentive for patrons, which would increase motivation, discover and messaging make it easier for community members to connect with each other, and ridesharing would empower users to be able to go to the market together.
