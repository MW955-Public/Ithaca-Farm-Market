# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.

    **Team name:** team-dot-js

    **Members:**
    * Ally Yuan (ahy7)
    * Toby Leung (htl9)
    * Jiayi Xu (jx347)
    * Morgan Aloia (mta47)
    * Mengxue Wang (mw955)


2. To what goals do we all commit?

    * To work effectively and harmoniously as a team in order to complete a project we are all proud of.
    * To meet the requirements of the client while also meeting user needs.
    * To learn and improve skills that will aid in future endeavors and projects.
    * To help each other and leverage each other's strengths.

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    * ***Be friendly.*** With all of us coming from different backgrounds (culturally and academically), we can each learn a lot from one another! Therefore, we should all be open to learning and sharing information amongst one another. This way, we would maximize our returns by the end of the semester.
    * ***Communicate well.*** In order for our project to go smoothly, we all need to be on the same page. The 5 of us should feel comfortable communicating at all points in time,and this begins by being open to listening.
    * ***Be on time.*** We should aim to be on time to meetings and with submissions. This is because it is no longer simply just one of our schedules at stake, but a collective one.


4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We plan on communicating informally on a need-to basis through a Facebook Messenger group chat. This is accompanied with a shared git repository, as well as an organized Google Drive directory.

    Furthermore, no digital communication methods can completely fulfill the qualities of meeting face-to-face. Ergo, we plan on having weekly meetings wherein we discuss current and upcoming tasks.


5. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    We will use Facebook Messenger for communication. We will speak to the client and people who are targets in our group either in person or via video call. 

6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

    We will have two main roles which are *UI/UX designers* for building prototypes and *developers* for implementation. UI/UX designers mainly work on creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes in accordance with user's needs. For developers, they will implement the code based on the satisfactory prototypes. For each of the team members, they will be assigned roles to work on the parts of the projects that they are conceptually weaker in to maximize learning opportunities. However, every member will contribute to both design and implementation portions. 

7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    To prevent this situation from happening, each member will be assigned specific responsibilities. We will work together on collabration systems where everyone should upload their work in a timely manner so that other members can serve as supervisors.

    If any of the above issues arise, we will have a team meeting to discuss concerns with points like, "We want to check in and see if you're okay because it seems like we're deviating from our collective goals." or "Is there anything we can do to help you accomplish your tasks?".

8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    We will figure out what exactly causes the conflicts and pause till all the related people understand our conflicts. After that, we gather the opinions from all the members to discuss these issues as a team and agree upon how to move forward.

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    We will review this contract on an as-needed basis when specific issues arise.


10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    We recognize that we all have plenty of other commitments, so we're gonna try not to overly stress over this project.
